1. Sync user entries with own dictionaries
   1. In Dutch, copy the glueless over to glued
   2. Add ^ to the start of every chord
   3. Run the following sed commands to add the glue and correct proper nouns
      #+begin_src vim
        %s/: "/: "\{\^\}/g
        %s/\^#/#\^/g
      #+end_src
   4. Save & commit all files
