Thanks for stopping by! This is where I keep all my dictionaries used for plover, a open-source stenography program. 

My Dutch.json contains a homemade flavor of Willem's Dutch dictionary, taking a more lapwing oriented approach and skipping the need for a "glue" key. Feel free to copy it to your own repository!
